/**
 * Adds a 50% ( customizeable ) chance for ETC (customizeable) items to drop from mobs with double quantity
 * Adds a 25% ( customizeable as well ) chance for it to use tripple quantity (this dice is only played if the 50% one succeeded)
 * Adds a 10% ( customizeable as well ) chance for it to use quadruple quantity (this dice is only played if the 25% one succeeded)
 * Adds a 5%  ( customizeable as well ) chance for it to use quintuple quantity (this dice is only played if the 10% one succeeded)
 * For example, after a player succeeds at dropping a jellopy (at any rate), theres a 50% chance it'll be 2 jellopies instead of 1,
 * and if that 50% succeeds, there'll be another 25% chance for it to be 3 instead of 2, and if that 25% succeeds,
 * there will be another 10% chance for it to drop 4 instead of 3, and if that 10% succeeds, there will be a 5% chance to drop 5 instead of 4.
 * - MvP drops are not affected
 * - Items looted by monsters are not affected
